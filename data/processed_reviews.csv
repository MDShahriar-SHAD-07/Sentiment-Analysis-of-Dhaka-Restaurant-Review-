𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 The restaurant has this nice, cozy feel to it. It's trying to give off that Western steakhouse vibe, and they do a pretty good job at it.

Small, tasty bites that got us ready for the main course. Worth trying! • 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗶𝗱𝗲𝘀: • Mashed potatoes were smooth as silk and perfectly creamy • Mexican rice had good flavor • BBQ sauce complemented everything nicely 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀 Nothing fancy here - just your regular drinks like coke, sprite, fanta etc., water, and some local options like Mojo. They were cold and refreshing, which is what matters! 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗲 Let's be honest - ৳21,255 (with VAT) for seven people isn't cheap.

From the moment I walked in, I was captivated by the warm and inviting ambiance. The rustic, cowboy-themed decor with long wooden tables, stylish chairs, and subtle Western accents created a cozy yet sophisticated atmosphere. The soft lighting and tasteful decorations made the environment feel relaxed and welcoming, perfect for a casual meal or a special occasion. Now, let’s talk about the food—absolutely outstanding! I tried both the ribeye and T-bone steaks, and both exceeded my expectations. The ribeye was perfectly marbled, juicy, and cooked to perfection, easily one of the best I’ve had in Dhaka. The T-bone had a rich, robust flavor and was equally satisfying. Each steak was thoughtfully plated with sides like creamy mashed potatoes, sautéed vegetables, and grilled tomatoes, which complemented the main dishes beautifully. The homemade sauces, especially the mushroom and cheese options, added a gourmet touch that elevated the experience even further. Don't forgot to try the the hollandaise and cheese sauces. It's a must. If you don’t try the corn salad, you gonna miss the most delicious corn salad in town. The service was excellent. The staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, guiding me through the menu and ensuring that my dining experience was seamless. They were professional yet warm, making me feel genuinely welcomed. Woodhouse Grill also offers convenient facilities such as free street parking and multiple payment options. Their special offers on Sundays and Tuesdays make the visit even more appealing for steak enthusiasts. Overall, Woodhouse Grill is a must-visit for anyone who loves premium steaks in Dhaka. The combination of exceptional food, inviting ambiance, top-notch service, and thoughtful facilities makes it an unforgettable experience.

Service was decent—I'd say good overall. But after eating, they asked us to leave because of waiting guests.

The food here is awesome. Nothing felt/tasted like it needed any improvement. The Chicken Cordon Bleu is the best I have had in Dhaka. The Grilled Chicken Mango Salad had a good amount of mango and the right balance. The Cream of Mushroom Soup was tasty and the bread enclosure it comes with helps its cause. The Apple Iced Tea had a nice balanced taste. But for me the star of the show was the Mango Pie. It truly was mesmerizing and the sweetness just felt right.

Situated alongside a golf course, the restaurant offers delightful views, particularly from its semi-outdoor seating area. The establishment was not overly crowded, allowing me to relish the tranquility and peacefulness. Regarding the food, we decided to begin with a combination starter consisting of chicken fry, prawn on toast, and chicken wonton. For our main course, we selected Chicken Valencia and Spaghetti Bolognese. While the food was not exceptionally outstanding, it was still tasty. The prawn on toast was satisfactory, and the crispy layer of the fried chicken could have been improved. However, the quantity of food provided for the main course more than justified the price. Both the spaghetti and the chicken portion were generous enough for a single person. I believe that slightly reducing the dryness of the spaghetti would greatly enhance its overall appeal. All in all, it was a highly enjoyable experience for me. The quality and quantity of the food, along with the reasonable pricing and inviting ambiance, convinced me that I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a family dinner or a gathering.",,palm view restaurant,positive,0.47962337732315063,True,neutral,0.35086777806282043,False,,0.0,True,neutral,0.6663874387741089,True,positive,0.8383968472480774,False,,0.0,No Conflict,2,True

Our culinary adventure included indulging in the famed fuchka platter and opting for the rice bowl package. While the taste of the fuchka platter met our expectations, the overall experience fell short of the hype surrounding it. The fuchka platter, undoubtedly the star attraction, showcased an array of flavors and textures. The burst of tangy and spicy sensations with each bite of the crispy shells filled with delectable concoctions left a favorable impression. However, the anticipation built around this dish may have elevated our expectations to a level that reality struggled to match. On the other hand, the rice bowl package failed to justify its price tag. The dish lacked the finesse and flavor complexity that one would expect for the amount paid. The rice seemed uninspiring, and the accompanying elements failed to elevate the overall dining experience. This disconnect between price and quality left us somewhat disappointed. Despite our initial excitement about the fuchka platter, we found it essential to acknowledge that its reputation might have been inflated. While enjoyable, it may not be the unparalleled experience some might lead you to believe. Managing expectations is crucial when venturing into the culinary offerings at Barcode Cafe. The ambiance and service at the cafe were commendable, providing a comfortable setting for our dining experience. The staff were attentive and accommodating, contributing positively to our overall visit. In conclusion, Barcode Cafe offers a culinary journey with highs and lows.

So overall i would give it a 4/10 nb: there was a under construction part beside our table. Second part : The Food journey Ok there is a reason i called it a journey because i took the Buffet dinner offer. Lets start. We stared with soup . Then sushi,sandwich and salad. The worst part was everything was cold as f. It was really disappointing. Then we tried the bbq section. From there i only like the prawn. Chicken bbq was horrible and beef stake was..... i forgot how it was. After i only tasted boiled fish, grilled chicken, lamd,beef stu, vegetable biriany, and i dont like any of it From the vey beginning i was hoping for a desert ride and it didn't go well. It was beautiful from outside. Thats it about food . I will give it a 2/10 because of the prawn and the bottled mineral water. Third part: The PRICE The dinner buffet was 3500bdt net per person. I wouldn't mind if had one portion of satisfaction from the food . But i would recommend to spend the money in other places. 2/10 Overall rating from my experience 3/10 See for yourself",,sky pool restaurant,neutral,0.43578532338142395,True,neutral,0.4398265779018402,False,,0.0,True,neutral,0.8530029654502869,True,neutral,0.5857468843460083,False,,0.0,No Conflict,0,False

The restaurant's ambience is a blend of traditional Korean aesthetics and modern luxury, making it an ideal spot for both casual dining and special occasions. The decor at Goong The Castle is truly a feast for the eyes. The restaurant is designed to resemble a traditional Korean castle, with intricate woodwork, soft lighting, and tasteful artwork adorning the walls. The seating is comfortable, with both private dining areas and communal tables, making it suitable for intimate dinners or larger gatherings. The menu at Goong The Castle is extensive, offering a wide variety of authentic Korean dishes. The highlight is undoubtedly the barbecue, where diners can grill their own meats at the table. The quality of the ingredients is top-notch, with the beef and pork being particularly tender and flavorful. The side dishes (banchan) are plentiful and varied, providing a perfect complement to the main dishes. The kimchi, a staple of Korean cuisine, is well-prepared and has the right balance of spice and tanginess. For those less inclined towards barbecue, the menu also offers a range of other traditional dishes such as bibimbap, japchae, and various stews. The seafood pancake (haemul pajeon) is crispy and generously filled with fresh seafood, while the spicy tofu stew (soondubu jjigae) is comforting and rich in flavor. The service at Goong The Castle is attentive and polite, with staff members eager to explain the menu and offer recommendations. They are quick to respond to requests and ensure that the dining experience is smooth and enjoyable. However, during peak hours, the service can be slightly slower due to the high volume of diner. Goong The Castle is on the pricier side, especially compared to other dining options in Gulshan. However, considering the quality of the food, the unique dining experience, and the elegant setting, it offers good value for money. It's a place where you go not just to eat, but to savor a culinary journey. Goong The Castle is a must-visit for anyone in Dhaka looking to experience authentic Korean cuisine in a luxurious setting.

Dhela Kichuri/Letka Khichuri with Beef- 399tk Tasted superb & it had achari flavor in it. This is one of their best seller. The meat was flavorful & tender but i feel the quantity doesn’t do justice to the amount paid. Chotpoti- 130tk This was pretty average or basic. If you are extremely craving for chotpoti while visiting this place, you might give it a go. Chicken Keema Moghlai Porota- 220tk This was again good but the price was way too high. Chicken Chap with 2 Luchi- 395tk This was another hit item & the portion of the chicken was satisfactory. Their chap is one of the best one i had. The luchis were light & went perfectly. However the price is high sadly. Luchi & Aloor dom- 210tk The alur dom had an achari flavor to it & tasted yum but the 1st day i went, they served microscopic amount of potatoes. The next day upon requesting they served comparatively more. The taste was good but i request them to serve more potatoes as its called alur dom not jhol dom. Jilapi with rabri (Large)- 299tk We all loved this jilapi. It was not too sweet, was very crispy & had the aroma of ghee in it. Masala Tea- 110tk The 1st time i were there, i ordered ghee bakorkhani with it which you need to pay extra but it totally lacked the ghee flavor even though this tea was pretty good. I recommend the tea but not the bakorkhani since its just a basic one.

Ordered their Fried Wonthon(8/10), Chicken Corn Soup (10/10), Chicken Cashewnut Salad(6.5/10), Chicken Fried Rice(7/10), Spring Fried Chicken(6.5/10) and Coconut Ice Cream (9/10)🍧 Had a very basic menu at a Thai place having family at hand. Each of their items are at a proportion for 3 people except the coconut ice cream Starting with their Fried Wonthon rating it a solid 8/10.. They were crispy and perfectly fried..though would've liked a bit more filling as the filling wasn't even noticeable in taste. Paired along the Chicken Corn Soup..Would give it a 10/10... This is the best corn soup I've had in a while..The broth was thick, filled with chicken and egg and had a buttery creamy texture to it..The smell of butter escalated the taste so much better Then tried only two main courses and a salad as we were full already... Chicken Fried Rice paired with Spring Fried chicken..and chicken cashewnut salad on the side. Would rate the chicken fried rice a 7/10 ... The fried rice was however very average tasting. The big slices of chicken in the rice were however bland tasting.. didn't pair well with the rice...their fried rice needs quite an improvement... Their spring fried chicken also felt quite bland to me inside..it felt not well marinated and not juicy inside..Rating this a 6.5/10 and the coating while being crispy.. didn't add much to the taste. Together the rice and spring fried chicken paired better together... I would give the cashewnut salad a 5/10 as well ... It was too saucy and too tangy for our taste...not the traditional cashewnut salad we love...we had to pick and eat the chicken pieces and the nuts were too sour to eat...Even though I like a cashewnut salad saucy/dry..they went overboard with the sauce..so much so it felt more like almost a curry rather than a salad. Their coconut ice cream garnished with peanuts and a layer of sticky rice beneath is a solid 9/10. Loved it...It was refreshing like the waves of the sea... Even though I've heard people complaining about their proportions,I found the portions quite commendable and more than adequate for 3 people having a 2-3 course meal... I'd say 4 people could easily share their 1:3 portions. Would've loved if the staff were more welcoming. Wanted to strike up by praising on their proportion but instead received an underwhelming smile😅 There behavior was however friendly..but could've been more warm.

The portion of French fries was very minimal, yet priced at 220 BDT + VAT, which felt unreasonable. Overall, the experience was quite dissatisfying. On a positive note, the blueberry cheesecake and tiramisu were delightful and maintained their usual quality. However, despite being a loyal customer for many years, I am disappointed with the recent changes. At such high prices, I no longer find the pasta and French fries to be worth ordering. Alfresco has always been my first choice for pasta, but after today’s experience, I feel let down. While price increases are understandable, the quality and quantity should be maintained or even improved to ensure a fair dining experience for regular customers.",,alfresco banani,neutral,0.38709282875061035,False,,0.0,False,,0.0,True,negative,0.7389879822731018,False,,0.0,False,,0.0,No Conflict,1,True

In my entire life I have never seen chicken sizzling without smoke and any heat. Felt like they had premade chicken sizzling and they just warmed it for 30 second in oven & served. Also it was too sour. Waste of money. I had drinks with my food. They did not serve it . When I asked at almost at the end of our meal then they gave us drinks.

My recent visit left me with mixed feelings about the food but impressed by the overall experience. The sushi at Sura was, in my opinion, average. While it was well-presented, it lacked the finesse and flavor complexity you might expect from top-tier Korean sushi. It’s decent for a quick sushi fix, but it didn’t stand out as a highlight of the meal. Apparently the spicy tuna roll is made from canned tuna, UNACCEPTABLE when you are charging these prices. Where Sura truly shines is its meat dishes. The Korean BBQ and other meat-based offerings were good. The flavors were bold, the meat was tender and perfectly cooked, and the accompanying banchan (side dishes) elevated the experience to another level. Whether it was the bulgogi or the grilled short ribs, each bite was packed with authentic Korean flair. The service at Sura deserves high praise. The staff was attentive, friendly, and quick to accommodate requests, making the dining experience seamless and enjoyable. The restaurant itself is spotlessly clean, with a modern and inviting vibe that strikes a perfect balance between cozy and upscale. The 6th-floor location adds a nice touch, offering a pleasant view of the Gulshan area. Overall, Sura Korean Restaurant is a gem for meat lovers and those seeking a lively yet comfortable dining atmosphere.

We chose the quieter area after Eid to chat with friends peacefully, avoiding the busier, budget-friendly spots. However, the restaurant staff disappointed us. Although one part of the restaurant was empty, they asked us to leave to accommodate a reservation, even though other tables were available. I found their behavior upsetting.

One noticeable issue is the lack of advertising, which limits its visibility and potential to attract a broader customer base. A more robust marketing strategy could significantly enhance its reach and help it gain the recognition it deserves. Additionally, there appears to be a lack of skilled manpower. While the staff is courteous, service could be more efficient and professional with proper training and an increase in skilled personnel.

Pros: ✅ Gorgeous panoramic city views ✅ Tasty food with good portion sizes ✅ Great atmosphere Cons: ✅Long waiting time for food during busy hours ✅Can be very crowded Would definitely recommend for the experience — just don’t come in a rush..",,skyfall,positive,0.7477965354919434,True,positive,0.8256620764732361,True,negative,0.7868417501449585,False,,0.0,True,positive,0.753765344619751,False,,0.0,No Conflict,1,True

Whether you're celebrating something special or just in the mood to treat yourself, The Beast delivers. My only wish? A stronger, more diverse menu to match the rest of the excellence.

Back then, Dhaba was a cozy, casual spot that my friends and I frequented for its affordable and tasty meals. However, the restaurant has since migrated to a new location and undergone quite a transformation. We ordered the Fuchka Platter, Dahi Fuchka Milkshake, and Pad Thai. I must say, the food was good, just as I remembered. The fuchka was crispy and flavorful, with just the right amount of spice, and the Dahi Fuchka Milkshake was a unique and refreshing take on the classic. The Pad Thai was tasty, with a nice balance of sweet, tangy, and savory flavors. However, the experience felt very different from what Dhaba used to be. The new ambiance is polished and elegant, which gives off more of a fine-dining vibe rather than the everyday eatery it once was. While I appreciate the effort to elevate the atmosphere, it feels like the charm of the old Dhaba has been lost in the process. One major downside is the price. The dishes, though delicious, are now significantly more expensive, despite being the same items from the old menu. What was once an affordable spot for students has turned into a place that feels out of reach for a casual meal. Overall, Dhaba still offers good food, but the price hike and change in vibe make it less of a go-to spot for me.",,dhaba banani,positive,0.48580119013786316,True,positive,0.424384742975235,False,,0.0,True,negative,0.3939961791038513,True,positive,0.5413633584976196,False,,0.0,No Conflict,1,True

When we asked for fresh cutlery (since we didn’t know which “trash spoon” belonged to whom anymore), they just pointed out a few and we had to ask again.

Now, let's talk about the food – it was absolutely incredible! The menu offers a variety of dishes that made my taste buds dance. I tried the Rainbow Roll, and it was nothing short of perfection. The freshness of the ingredients really stood out. The Sirloin Steak was another highlight – cooked to perfection and bursting with flavors that left me craving more. It’s clear that the chef here puts a lot of care and attention into every dish.

However, the restaurant is located in a rather congested area, which makes parking and entry a bit difficult, especially during busy hours. While the variety of food is impressive, one major issue is how the popular dishes like beef and kachchi biryani are handled. As soon as the dishes are refilled, a few people rush to take all the meat, leaving only rice or pilaf behind for others. It feels like you have to fight to get a fair share of the main items. The management should control this better — perhaps by having the staff serve these popular items directly when the restaurant is crowded.

In this post I am going to tell you how this restaurant beautifully served us a pan of sizzling beef which actually was something else molded to give us the impression of feeding us the meat. Therefore, please read until the last. Orders were: Lemon soup- We tried this soup because we wanted to try out a light clear soup with a spicy and sour taste. Every spoonful was soury, light and packed with chicken and prawns and spring onions. Serves 5 pax at most. Rating 17/20; Taka 520. American chopsuey- The noodles were a tad bit more fried than it should have been that gave out a little burned taste. Nonetheless, the gravy served with the chopsuey was ordinarily tasty, topped with a properly seasoned fried egg with sunny side up. Rating 15/20; Price Taka 585; Served 5 pax. Sweet and Sour Fish- They used what we call in Bangla “Bhetki” to make this dish. The taste of the gravy was nicely balanced between the sweet and the sour although the fish still reeked of itself, I guess they did not wash the fish properly prior to cooking. Rating 13/20; Price Taka 575; Serving size 4-6 pax. Special fried rice- The rice was perfectly fried, seasoned and packed with chopped vegetables, chicken bits, prawns and scrambled eggs. Rating 18/20; Price Taka 525; Serving Size 5-6 pax. Mixed Greek Wok- Stir fried subtly flavoured mixed vegetables are a delight that complemented the rice beautifully. Price- Taka 495; Rating 17/20; Serving size 4-5 pax. Sizzling Beef: Could anything go wrong with a pan of sizzling beef? It looks delectably appetizing, initial smell is heavenly that you want to take your fork to dig into the deliciousness. But New Cathay has pathetically failed in this dish; Most of the shreds of meat were not beef but rather flour molded and fried and cooked in the gravy and served on the sizzling pan. The meat pieces were soggy and did not at all taste and look like meat. Price Taka 645; Rating 10/20; Serving size 5 pax. Lemon Water- One of the most healthiest drinks you could order at a restaurant that could burn your fat while you dine and at the same time spoiling your taste if you are in the mood to indulge into delicious food. A moderately sized freshly squeezed lemon juice was served with a bottle of “MUM” water, whereby the drinker can mix the lemon juice with the water as many times as the water in the bottle finishes. Price Taka 120; Rating 17/20. The waiters were well mannered and their service was moderately good.

Additionally, there was a kids' playground nearby, causing consistent noise that might be bothersome for those seeking a quiet dinner. Unfortunately, the service wasn't good, and we had to wait a long time for our food. It's possible that a party was taking place, and the staff was under pressure, leaving little time for other customers. However, if this was the case, it raises the question of why they would continue with side service while already stretched thin. After waiting for approximately an hour, we received our food. Although we had no complaints about the food, we were disappointed with the soup, which tasted like drinking water with a hint of Thai soup flavor. The restaurant needs to improve the quality of the soup. One thing we noticed was that the food menu items were mainly designed for three people. As we were a group of four people, it wasn't enough for us. When we asked the waiter if they could prepare a dish for four people, he said, ""You have to order the item again, Sir."" We found this to be unfair. For instance, the mixed fried rice cost 360 Taka for three people, so to serve four people, we would need to order the dish again, making it a total of 360 + 360 = 720 Taka. It was very disappointing, but we had no other choice but to order two fried rice dishes. Furthermore, when it came to ordering fried chicken, we were informed that they only had options for six pieces or twelve pieces - nothing in between. This showed that they were prioritizing business over customer satisfaction. The restaurant should reconsider its menu, as we saw many families of four people facing similar issues.

As someone who's lived in Oman and grown up loving Turkish BBQ and grilled dishes, I was curious to see if this place could bring back those rich, smoky memories—and it did not disappoint! We tried the Sarma & Chicken Beyti Kebab (T-11). This dish was a treat—soft flatbread wrapped around juicy grilled chicken and sarma, perfectly seasoned with aromatic spices. Served with rice, fries, grilled tomato, and a blend of tangy yogurt and rich tomato sauce, every bite was packed with flavor. It struck a great balance between tender meat, warm bread, and bold spices. We also had their Lemon Mint drink, which was super refreshing and complemented the heaviness of the meal beautifully. The ambiance was cozy, service was prompt, and the presentation was top-notch. For a restaurant this new, Pavo is off to a great start.

It’s clearly designed with families in mind but also includes a smoking zone, which makes it a suitable spot for younger customers. I visited during the day, and while the natural light complemented the warm interior, my overall experience was far from satisfying because the food fell short in many ways. Cream of Mushroom Soup I started with the Cream of Mushroom soup, and it was just okay. The flavor was decent, and the soup had a good amount of mushrooms, but the texture wasn’t right. It was a bit too watery, lacking the creamy richness you expect from this dish. While it wasn’t bad, it wasn’t something I’d recommend or order again. Rating: 7.5/10 BBQ Chicken Next, I tried the BBQ Chicken, which turned out to be a major disappointment. The sauce didn’t taste like BBQ at all—it was bland and unbalanced. Even worse, the chicken had a strange, unpleasant flavor that made it hard to eat. It didn’t seem fresh, which was a real letdown. This dish didn’t live up to any expectations. Rating: 3/10 The Platter The platter was, unfortunately, the biggest failure of the visit. The rice was the only part that was somewhat decent, but even that was just average. They tried to make the dish unique by including a special kind of salad, but the idea backfired because it tasted bad. As for the chicken, it had the same problems as the BBQ Chicken—it didn’t taste fresh, it was bitter, and the sauce didn’t go with it at all. The entire dish felt poorly thought out and badly executed. Rating: 1/10 (only because of the rice) Presentation and Service The food presentation didn’t help either. It looked plain and unappealing, which matched the poor taste of the dishes. On the bright side, the customer service was quite good. The server was polite and attentive, asking for feedback at the end of the meal. When I shared my honest thoughts, they kindly offered to replace the food. However, I didn’t accept because I was short on time and felt that replacing the food wouldn’t solve the underlying issues. While Pave has a good ambiance, especially during the daytime, and friendly service, the food is the heart of any restaurant, and this is where it really struggles. From the lack of freshness to poorly executed dishes, it was a disappointing experience overall. For now, I wouldn’t recommend visiting unless they make some major improvements to their menu and food quality.",,pavo restaurant dhaka,positive,0.5860032439231873,True,negative,0.6832768321037292,True,positive,0.6646401286125183,False,,0.0,False,,0.0,False,,0.0,Politeness Bias,1,True

It’s one of those classic, old-school Thai-Chinese family restaurants that you don’t come across often these days. The kind of place that quietly carries on with its legacy while the rest of the city moves on to trendy cafés and fast food joints. When we first entered, the restaurant was quiet and had a slightly gloomy ambiance. It wasn’t particularly busy, and for a moment, it felt like we had stepped into a forgotten corner of the neighborhood. But that quickly changed. As soon as we walked in, both the manager and the waiter greeted us with warm smiles and a genuinely welcoming attitude. Their enthusiasm at having guests made us feel instantly comfortable. We were shown to our seats, and within moments, the manager came over to recommend a few dishes. He seemed proud of the menu, which was a mix of Thai and Chinese classics. We appreciated his suggestions and ended up ordering the **Seafood Mix**, **Wonton Soup**, **Chowmein**, and a few refreshing drinks. When the food arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by the generous portions. The **Seafood Mix** was especially impressive—loaded with prawns, crabs, calamari, and cooked to perfection with bold flavors that didn’t overpower the natural taste of the seafood. The **Wonton Soup** was comforting, with soft, flavorful dumplings swimming in a rich broth, and the **Chowmein** had just the right amount of seasoning, veggies, and meat to balance it all out. Everything tasted delicious. It reminded us of the kind of food we used to enjoy in restaurants growing up—hearty, flavorful, and served with care. Garden Ship may not have the flashy decor or Instagrammable lighting that newer places boast, but it has something far more valuable: heart. It's a **hidden gem** in the heart of Mohammadpur, and it's a little sad to think that places like this are slowly fading away from the city’s dining scene. If you're someone who enjoys classic comfort food and appreciates warm hospitality, Garden Ship is absolutely worth a visit. Support your local family-run restaurants—they often hold the most authentic flavors and the warmest memories.",,garden ship ️,neutral,0.40816009044647217,True,neutral,0.40152162313461304,True,positive,0.7128494381904602,False,,0.0,True,positive,0.4338594377040863,False,,0.0,No Conflict,2,True

I ordered the chicken pasta oven-baked, and unfortunately, it failed on every level — starting with false advertising. Here’s a breakdown of the issues: 🐔 No Chicken (Yes, Really) Despite the name of the dish being chicken pasta, there was literally no chicken in the entire serving. Not even a single shred. I even double-checked to make sure it wasn’t hidden beneath the pasta — but it simply wasn’t there. For a dish marketed as “chicken pasta,” this is completely unacceptable. 🧀 Cheese? Barely There. I expected a rich, cheesy pasta — but it was almost completely dry. There was barely any cheese, and the little that was present didn’t even taste fresh or melted. It lacked both flavor and texture. 🔥 Not Oven-Baked The description clearly said “oven-baked,” but the dish felt like it was hastily microwaved or reheated. It had none of the crispy, golden-baked finish that oven-baked pasta is known for. The top wasn’t browned, the cheese wasn’t bubbling, and there were cold spots throughout — another indicator that this wasn’t baked at all. This dish felt like a careless afterthought. It was misleading, bland, and not what I paid for. If I wanted plain, dry pasta with no protein or cheese, I would have stayed home and made it myself.",,happy bites,negative,0.8808578252792358,True,negative,0.743980884552002,False,,0.0,False,,0.0,False,,0.0,False,,0.0,No Conflict,0,False

The overall place and seating was really odd, the main dining area was a bit tight and the tables are really close together, another section was far off in the corner and another section of seating in a little hallway area, lighting was extremely bright. One good spot was the seating area in the balcony but probably only good in the day time as at night there are too many mosquitoes. Anyways on to the food: we had the following: Seafood Soup: Soup was quite tasty, nice flavors all around. Seafood Appetizer: The batter of this dish was too thick. So you barely tasted what was inside and it was like eating a donut. Also there was not alot of fish and more vegetables in this dish. Seafood Lasagna: Horrible dish, chewy and rubbery. We couldn’t even eat it. Curry Hurry Fish: Really good, the fish was fresh, the sauce on this dish was really flavorful. A very deshi style dish with a modern twist. My only complain is that the quantity of rice is too little, there should be more rice considering the size of the fish. Fish cake: Fish cake tasted fresh but nothing special, sauce with the fish cake was way too sweet! Surf and Turf: Really bland piece of steak with two tiny shirmp, there was no surf in this surf and turf. I was shocked that a fish restaurant didn’t have a “Fish and Chips” on the menu, really odd. Service: Very poor service, our waiter barely understood a word of english. In this area and in a high end restaurant, the waiters should speak and understand basic english. Even when speaking Bangla, waiter didn’t seem to knowledgeable about their dish. When I asked what is the fish used in the “curry hurry fish dish”, his answer was “ocean fish” 😐. Also the overall demeanor and care was not there. Never came to check once how the food was or if we needed anything, we constantly had to call and ask for basic things like sauce and water. Also one thing I found extremely uncomfortable was when we were eating, the entire staff of about 6/7 people all standing in the main dining area. It was just weird and an uneasy feeling.
